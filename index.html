<div class="par"><h2><p class ="sp1"> WHAT IS CHEMISTRY?</p></h2>	
<p>Chemistry is a branch of the physical sciences (the others being Physics, Astronomy, and Earth science) that deals with the <em>chemical composition</em>, <em>structure</em>,
<em>properties</em>, <em>behavior</em> and <em>reactions </em>of<em> matter</em>. 
In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology.It is sometimes called the central science because it provides
a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.<br/><br/>
<u><b> Why Study Chemistry: </b></u> Chemistry is relevant in understanding our world, chemistry allows us to acquire knowledge about matter.
 We perform experiments and learn to observe, record and make intelligent inferences. The study of chemistry allows for the appreciation of the scientific method, and this knowledge 
 and training helps one become a scientist in the field of chemistry. Scientist who major in chemistry are known as chemists.</p>
<p><u><b> The Role of Chemistry in our Lives: </b></u> Chemical changes occur around us and within us all the time. Common chemical activities include
<ol type="i">
<li> Cooking</li>
<li>Rusting of iron</li>
<li>Digestion</li>
<li>fermentation of sugar</li>
<li>Decay of dead matter</li>
</ol>
Many every day items such as cosmetics, plastics and pharmaceuticals are made by applying the knowledge of chemistry.</p>
 
<p><h3 align="center"><u><b>THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD</b></u></h3>
    The development of chemistry has occurred through a series of breakthroughs and discoveries. Scientists over the years have observed phenomena around them, and from these observations,
    they deduce patterns which often lead to problems which they try to solve. They put forward a reasonable explanation or hypothesis and carry out experiments to test their hypothesis,
    and the observations and results of these experiments are carefully recorded.<br/>
    If the experiment supports the hypothesis, further investigations are carried out, the hypothesis and results from the experiment are discussed with other scientists in the same field
    (peer review). When a hypothesis has been tested and found to be correct within the limits of available evidence, it becomes a theory. A theory only becomes a<i> scientific principle</i> or <i>law</i>
    after it has been extensively tested and proven true without any exception.<br/>
    On the other hand, if the experiment produced a negative result, the scientist goes back to the hypothesis and either modify it or put forward a new one. This way of studying problems is known as the <i>scientific method</i>, it is the very foundation of all scientific research.

    <div class="par"> <h2><p class ="sp1"> WHAT IS MATTER ?</p></h2>    
     A simple definition of matter is anything that ocupies space and has mass( in other words matter can said to be a substance). There are three states of matter namely solid,liquid and gaseous. We are made up of matter and surrounded by
     matter, chemistry studies the building block of matter,
     how matter interacts , the forces that govern the states of matter e.t.c.<br/>
     Matter is made up of different type of chemical substances known as <em><u><a href="#element">Elements</a></u></em>. Substances can be made up of one or more type of elements,
     and these elements may be combined physically or chemically.
     Substances that contains one or more elements combined chemically are known as <em><u><a href="#compound">Compounds</a></u></em>, where as those that contain elements or compounds physically combined
     are called <em><u><a href="#mixture">Mixtures</a></u></em>. A substance can also be made up of only one type of element e.g a pure Copper(Cu) bar.
     Examples of compounds are water( H<sub>2</sub>O), common salt (NaCl) e.t.c, mixtures include things like air,crude oil, salt solutions e.t.c.<br/> 
     </div>
     <div class="par" id="element"> <h2><p class ="sp1">ELEMENTS</p></h2>   
     Elements can be defined as a substance that cannot be chemically broken down into any other substance.There are 118 elements known to man, 94 are naturally occuring on Earth and 24 are 
    synthetic. Each element is a kind(specie) of atoms, the diffence in atoms leads to the difference in the chemical and physical properties of elements. Examples of elements include 
    Gold(Au), Oxygen(O), Chlorine(Cl), and Lawrencium(Lr).
     </div>
     <div id="compound"class="par"> <h2><p class ="sp1">COMPOUNDS</p></h2>
        In chemistry, a compound is a material made up of two or more different elements which are chemically combined. Compouns can be combined covalently
        or ionically(electrovalent combination).
    </div>
     <div id="mixture"class="par"> <h2><p class ="sp1">MIXTURES</p></h2>
     In chemistry, a mixture is a material made up of two or more different substances which are mixed in the form of solutions, suspensions and colloids. in other 
    words, the various substances in a mixture retain their chemical properties and can be seperated using their physical properties such as melting point, solubility,density e.t.c

     <div id="mixture"class="par"> <h2><p class ="sp1">USES OF CHEMISTRY</p></h2>
        Chemistry has contributed greatly to improving the quality of life and providing the basic needs of billions of people all over the world. Chemistry has impacted in the following areas:
        <ul type="cube">
            <li><span class="span1"> Food:</span> Fertilizers and pesticides have helped to increase food production, chemical processes are used to preserve food 
                and nutrients are added to some food products like flour and sugar to fight malnutrition.
            </li>
            <li><span class="span1"> Clothing:</span> Man made materials such as nylon has made clothing materials cheaper, and the development of 
                synthetic dyes have made it possible to produce cloths of all colours and hues.
            </li>
            <li><span class="span1"> Space Science:</span> Spectrochemistry is used to study the components of stars, planets and other 
                bodies in space. The development of rocket fuels and other materials used in space exploration is dependent on chemistry.
            </li>
            <li><span class="span1"> Medicine :</span> Chemistry has helped with the development of drugs and many chemicals that have greatly
                increased the life expectancy of people all over the world.
            </li> 
            <li><span class="span1"> Energy and Transportation</span> 
            The use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy has been possible due to chemistry,        </li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="mixture"class="par"> <h2><p class ="sp1">NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CHEMISTRY</p></h2>
           Chemistry also has an heavy toll on the environment despite of all the benefits it has brought to mankind. The 
           following are some of the negative impacts.
           <ul>
            <li><span class="span1">Pollution</span> 
                Chemical wastes from factories, oil refineries, and nuclear plants, oil spillage, exhaust from motor vehicles, pesticides, fertilizer runoff,
                and acid rain harm the environment and endanger plant and animal life. Air pollution is one of the largest 
                causes of death worldwide.<br/>
                The development of non-biodegradable materials and the high use of single-use plastics have led to massive pollution of water bodies and land all over the world. Microplastics have even been found in plankton and other marine organism.            </li>
     <li><span class="span1">Drug Abuse</span> 
        The abuse of chemical substances both naturally occurring and synthetic is also one of the negative impacts of chemistry. Drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine are highly
    addictive and has led to the destruction of the lives of many.</li>
        <li><span class="span1">Nuclear Anhilation</span> 
            The threat of the destruction of human civilisation through a nuclear war is real. There are more than enough nuclear weapons in the world to destroy human civilisation if not wipe out humanity.  </li>      
    </ul>
