 <div class="par"><h2><p class ="sp1">HYDROGEN</p></h2>  
    Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe, it is found in the sun and most of the stars and the planet Jupiter is composed mostly of hydrogen. It has a standard atomic weight 0f 1.008,      atomic number 1 
    and symbol H. It is the lightest element in the <a href="Table.html">periodic table</a>. It was discovered by Henry Cavendish in
    1766 and was named by Antoine Lavoisier in 1783, the name was derived from the Greek words <i>hydro</i> meaning water and <i>genes</i> meaning creator (water maker) due to the fact that hydrogen forms water when burnt in air. It is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas which is highly inflammable when in contact with oxygen.
    It belongs to Group 1 and Period 1 on the periodic table. it is a reactive non-metal with an electron configuration of 1s<sup>1</sup>, it has a single eletron in its shell.
    <br/><br/>
    <b><u> OCCURENCE </u> </b>: Hydrogen is found in minute quantity in the Earth's atmosphere where it makes about 1 part per million of the atmosphere by volume,where it occurs in the Diatomic form H<sub>2</sub>.
    Although hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe 
    , it makes up only about 0.14 percent of Earth’s crust by weight. It occurs, however, in vast quantities as part of the water in oceans, ice packs, rivers, lakes, and
     the atmosphere. As part of innumerable carbon compounds, hydrogen is present in all animal and vegetable tissue and in petroleum. Even though it is often said that there 
     are more known compounds of carbon than of any other element, the fact is that, since hydrogen is contained in almost all carbon compounds and also forms a multitude of compounds with all other elements (except some of the noble gases),
     it is possible that hydrogen compounds are more numerous.<br/><br/>
    <b><u> OXIDATION NUMBER OF HYDROGEN </u> </b>: Hydrogen has an oxidation number of 1 in most of its compound except in hydrides where it has an oxidation number of -1.
     <br/><br/>
     <b><u>LABORATORY PREPARATION OF HYDROGEN</u> </b>: Hydrogen can be prepared in the laboratory using the following techniques:
     <ol>
     <li><p> Rection of dilute strong acids with metals such as Zinc.<br/>
     Zn<sub>(s)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><sub>(aq)</sub> &rarr; ZnSO<sub>4 (aq)</sub> + H<sub>2(g)</sub><br/>
     <img class="rxn1" src="images/H2prep.png"/>
     
     </p></li>
     <li><p> Reaction of Amphoteric metals with strong bases like Sodium Hydroxide.<br/>
     2Al<sub>(s)</sub> + 6NaOH<sub>(aq)</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> &rarr;  Na<sub>3</sub>[Al(OH)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>3(aq)</sub> + 3H<sub>2(g)</sub><br/>
     Zn<sub>(s)</sub> + 2NaOH<sub>(aq)</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>  &rarr;  Na<sub>2</sub>[Zn(OH)<sub>4</sub>]<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2(g)</sub>
     </p></li>
     <ii><p> Action of sodium on cold water.<br/>
     Sodium liberates hydrogen from cold water. This rection is very vigorous and should carried out with extreme care using only a small piece of sodium.<br/>
     2Na<sub>(s)</sub> +2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(aq)</sub> &rarr; 2NaOH(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2(g)</sub><br/>
     
     </p></li>
     </ol>
    <br/><br/>
     <b><u>INDUSTRIAL PREPARATION OF HYDROGEN</u> </b>: Hydrogen is produced industrially through the following processes:
     <ol>
     <li><p>Steam reforming natural gas<br/>
     CH<sub>4 (g)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub> &rarr; CO<sub>(g)</sub> + 3H<sub>2(g)</sub>
     </p></li>
      <li><p > Electrolysis of Water<br/>
      2H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; 2H<sub>2(g)</sub> + O<sub>2 (g)</sub>
      </p></li>
     </ol>
